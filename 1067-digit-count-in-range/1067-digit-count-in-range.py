        Rather than counting the occurence of d from each number, we count the the occurent of d on each digit from 1 to the number.

        Think about the form of the number abcTxyz and the current digit T, and we want to count the occurence of d on that position.
        1. If T>d, then from 000 to abc, each corresponds to 1000 counts
        2. If T==d, then from 000 to abc, each corresponds to 1000 counts except the last one, and xyz correponds to a count of abcT000 to abcTxyz, which is xyz+1 counts.
        3. If T<d, then only from 000 to abc(excluded), each corresponds to 1000 counts.

        Pay attention to d=0, for that case, we cannot start from 000, so we need to subtract them.
